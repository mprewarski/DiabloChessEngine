Diablo 0.2 	March 25, 2005

 - Fixed bug with UCI interface when getting number of moves left in games
 with time controls of X moves in Y minutes.  This could seriously affect
 performance in these games.

 - Fixed bug with attack board based SEE routines, attack boards were changing
 after null move search.

 - Fixed bug in futility pruning as pointed out by Tord Romstad.  Not a
 serious bug, but wasn't working how I thought.

 - Generate tables to use for calculating attack board based SEE.

 - Added bug fixes sent in by Dan Corbit.  Most changes involved sloppy
 function prototypes and in at least one case of not passing correct number of
 parameters to a function.  Thanks Dan.

 - Minor evaluation changes
    o Knight outposts
    o minor piece table changes
